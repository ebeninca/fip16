Hallo zusammen,

ich lese in ganz vielen Foren oft die Frage, wie man sich eine Liga in Fifa erstellen kann (ich selber habe hier ins Forum selbige Frage gestellt).

Aus diesem Grund möchte ich einfach kurz mit euch ein paar Infos teilen, welche ich bei der Recherche herausgefunden habe, für die ganzen Anfänger im Modden wie ich selber:

1. "Kurz"anleitung zum erstellen einer eigenen Liga:

Ich will mich nicht mit fremden Lorbeeren schmücken. Das folgende ist aus einem anderen Forum von einem Nutzer namens "Rune":

First before, I have to say: YOU CANNOT INSERT NEW CONTENT! REPLACE EXISTING CONTENT ONLY! THIS APPLIES TO LEAGUES, TEAMS, PLAYERS AND GRAPHICS!

Via the Frosty Editor you get to the CompData folder…. There save the files:

- Compobj

- Initeams

- Schedule

- Settings

- tasks

- Weather



Compobj

Here you regulate the structures of the tournaments and competitions from FIFA. Inserting a complete new tournament is not possible, but replacing an existing one is definitely possible.

Please note that if you add an additional round to a cup, you must also change all other competitions, `cause all stages, rounds and more are numbered here. It’s important for do not lose their connection to each other ... is a very complicated story.

For example, I inserted an additional main round with all 3rd league teams in the DFB Cup (Germany) because teams from the 3rd league only qualified or inserted by chance. So just look at the structure and try to understand!

Initeams

Here you assign the competitions, including all their stations, to the teams.

Schedule

If you replace an existing league and, for example, assign it to a league association (promotion and relegation), it is of course important to create an existing game plan or calendar.

Once you've gotten into it, that's actually one of the easiest changes.

Settings

All competitions and tournaments are managed here. Promotion and relegation, prize money, relegation markings, table sorting, start dates and and and.

Tasks

Important for FIFA to know what to do with the leagues and teams before and after a season.

Weather

Self-explanatory ... here you should choose an existing weather system for the appropriate region of the league

2. Dateien verstehen:

Wenn man sich die oben genannten Dateien anschaut, versteht man vermutlich am Anfang nur Bahnhof. Auch hier bin ich während meiner Recherchen auf einen Beitrag gestoßen:

Hierzu habe ich eine Sammlung von Erklärungen gefunden, die ich euch nicht vorenthalten möchte:


Compobj.txt

1. World line (specify the world as an object)
0,0,FIFA,FIFA,-1
a) Competition object ID (e.g. 0)
b) Numeric identifier: 0-FIFA world competition (e.g. 0)

a) Competition object ID (e.g. 70)
b) Numeric identifier: 1-confederation competition (e.g. 1)
c) Short description. This can be found in the database fce_competitioninfo/compobjshortdesc (e.g. UEFA)
d) Description. This can be found in the database fce_competitioninfo/compobjdesc (e.g. European FA)

Line FCE_Setup_Stage is used only to setup all teams participating in a competition and from there teams advance into the next stage. Imagine setup stage as a bowl from where qualified teams are drawn into a competition.

Das Tutorial zu den ganzen Dateien ist von einer alten Fifa Version. Dementsprechend kann es sein das sich eventuell an gewissen Stellen etwas verändert hat.

Bevor jemand Frage zu gewissen Modding spezifischen Sachen hat sollte gesagt sein: ich selber stehe grade noch ganz am Anfang vom Modding. Ich bring mir all das oben gerade noch selber bei. Allerdings hatte ich unglaublich Probleme überhaupt mal mit so etwas anzufangen weil ich nicht gewusst habe, wo ich Anfangen soll, was ich mit gewissen Dateien anfangen soll und ähnliches.

Deswegen wollte ich euch an meinen Recherchen teilhaben lassen. Ich hoffe damit könnt ihr alle verwirklichen, was ihr euch vorgenommen habt.

Zur Info: Alle oben genannten Infos habe ich nicht selber herausgefunden sondern lediglich aus anderen Foren zusammengesucht.
Falls die Erklärungen zu den Compdata Dateien zu unübersichtlich sind, habe ich eine .rar Datei angehängt mit allen PDF's wo nochmal alles etwas übersichtlicher erklärt ist.

Viel Spaß beim Modden

Grüße

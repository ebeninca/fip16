## Issues: 

- "Taça de Portugal" no happening/showing
- A chance of conflict on FIFA CWC exists between the host team and the winner of AFC or CAF Champions league, it's very rare, doesn't crash, cup still playable, no further action for now.
- New Zealand is qualifying to WC through CONCACAF Gold Cup, no changes made on it.
- CONCACAF Gold Cup not showing on tables full screen, same problem of AFC Asian Cup, still playable.
- Definir um jogo de final na Gold Cup, 

- v62 CAF Real Madrid (as ukraine national team manager): ukraine isn't in the euro qualifiers competition
- v62 CAF Al Ahly (as saudi arabia national team manager): shows "Copa America" table instead of "AFC Asian Cup" table. Not crashing, competition still playable.
- v62 CAF Real Madrid (as USA national team manager): FIFA CWC, Usan Hyundai always winning AFC Champions League? something broken?


## Future Features:

***** Testar check schedule conflicts - LigaMX / Real Madrid / Flamengo
- Changed dates on Brasileirao in december to avoid FIFA CWC date conflict
AJUSTAR - Added more dates to Liga MX in december to avoid FIFA CWC date conflict

***** TESTAR SIMULACAO COPA DO MUNDO EM 2022 - Eliminatorias Asia não está sendo usada, Nova zelandia não é considerada / Setar selecoes no ranking das eliminatorias para gera a copa corretamente.

***** Try to simplify the setup stages to leave some free compids to be used for new competitions or expand existing competitions (maybe this is causing long term crashings)
